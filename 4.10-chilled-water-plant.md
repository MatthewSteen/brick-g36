## 4.10.8 Waterside Economizer

It's unclear what class a WSE should be, which could be either...
- [Heat_Exchanger](https://brickschema.org/ontology/1.3/classes/Heat_Exchanger/)
- [Economizer](https://brickschema.org/ontology/1.3/classes/Economizer)

WSEs are essentially HXs, which makes me think that the `Heat_Exchanger` class needs a `Economizer_Heat_Exchanger` child class like `Damper` has a `Economizer_Damper` child class. Additionally, the `Economizer` class doesn't have any children, which makes me think it could be removed.
